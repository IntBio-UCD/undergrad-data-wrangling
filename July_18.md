## Notes on July 18

* Plan:
  - Answer any questions you have on the swirl tutorials
  - Discussion of questions that can be asked and answered using our data set
  - Introduction to Rmarkdown
  - Tidyverse tutorial
  - (if time allows) practice what you have learned on some of the real data (calculate means for each pop and maternal family)
  
Questions:
* do populations differ?
* do mfs differ?
* how much variance is there between pops, within pops, within mfs?
* what is the relationship between traits? e.g. are larger plants more or less likely to survive?  
* relationship to weather (flooding)
* relationship to home climate

Rmarkdown
* Demo a brief Rmarkdown file in Rstudio

Tidyverse
* What are some basic manipulations we might want to do to a data sheet?
  - Select certain columns
  - Filter based on some criteria
  - Arrange from low-to-high (or vice versa)
  - Create a new column by manipulating one or more old columns (mutate)
  - Summarize data
